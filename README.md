# Dockerfile for OpenBabel with Python bindings 

Dockerfile for a miminal Debian based image containing Open Babel and it's Python bindings.

The latest version of Open Babel that is available from Debian repos is for OpenBabel 2.3.2, which is a bit older than the latest versions.
We hope these will be updated at some stage. See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1766).
